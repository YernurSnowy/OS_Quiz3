# Real-time System Monitoring and Analysis Tool

## Description
This tool provides real-time monitoring and analysis of various system parameters, including CPU usage, available disk space, running processes, and more. It continuously collects data at one-minute intervals and presents insights through visualizations and text outputs.

## Features
1. **Continuous Data Collection:** The tool gathers system parameters at regular intervals, ensuring up-to-date information on system performance.
2. **Visualizations:** Graphical representations of CPU usage and available disk space over time allow for easy interpretation of trends.
3. **Process Analysis:** Identify processes with the highest average memory usage to optimize resource allocation.
4. **Customizable:** Users can customize monitoring parameters and analysis techniques to suit their specific needs.
5. **Peak CPU Usage:** The tool calculates and displays the peak CPU usage observed during the monitoring period.
6. **Average Disk Space:** Provides the average available disk space over the monitoring period for better resource management.

## Usage
1. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure Python and required libraries (psutil, matplotlib) are installed.
2. **Run the Script:** Execute the provided Python script to start monitoring the system.
3. **Interpret Results:** View the graphical visualizations and text outputs to analyze system performance.
4. **Customization:** Modify the code to add additional monitoring parameters or customize analysis techniques as needed.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- psutil
- matplotlib
